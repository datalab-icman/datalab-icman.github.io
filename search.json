    "text": "Any persisting collection of agents that interact with each other and feedback on their environment face the same problem: how to cope with fluctuations while maintaining long-term integrity. This is true whether the collection of agents refers to stem cells undergoing differentiation during development, species coexisting in an ecosystem, or traders maximizing profit in future markets. I call these ecologies. I try to escape the curse of reification, and value substance over form.  This lab focuses on:\n\nTransiency: How systems avoid vanishing away while flowing in a permanently transient state.\nFeedback loops: How interactions between agents and their environment shape persistence.\nRobustness: The ability of systems to mantain integrity amisdt fluctuations.\n\nIf you want a motto for the lab, keep this in mind:\n\n\n    Everything is moving"
