    "text": "Any persisting collection of agents that interact with each other and feedback on their environment face the same problem: how to cope with fluctuations while maintaining long-term integrity. This is true whether the collection of agents refers to stem cells undergoing differentiation during development, species coexisting in an ecosystem, or traders maximizing profit in future markets. I call these ecologies. I try to escape the curse of reification, and value substance over form.  This lab focuses on:\n\nTransiency: How systems avoid vanishing away while flowing in a permanently transient state.\nFeedback loops: How interactions between agents and their environment shape persistence.\nRobustness: The ability of systems to mantain integrity amisdt fluctuations.\n\nIf you want a motto for the lab, keep this in mind:\n\n\n    Everything is moving"

    "text": "The Data Lab ICMAN is an external Scientific-Technological Core Facility of the ICMAN-CSIC focused on providing advice on mathematical and statistical analysis associated with marine research projects. Recognizing that contemporary science faces unprecedented challenges due to the complexity of the questions and the immense volume of data generated, this platform was created to offer the rigorous technical and methodological support essential for successfully developing high-impact research.\nTo this end, the ICMAN Data Lab provides the scientific community with cutting-edge analytical and computational capabilities. This includes not only high-performance data processing, essential for managing large data sets, but also a range of multipurpose statistical methodologies and the ability to perform predictive numerical simulations. The ultimate goal is to accelerate and enhance the exploration and analysis of data, both observational and experimental, as well as the computational models linked to them. This is achieved by implementing reproducible workflows based on open-source mathematical and statistical tools, ensuring the transparency, replicability, and robustness of results. In this way, the service seeks to position advanced data analysis as a foundational asset for marine science that addresses the most urgent dynamics of global change. The areas covered by the service are as follows:\n\nGeneral areas:\n✓ Exploratory and Confirmatory Data Analysis\n✓ Mathematical and Statistical Computing and Modeling\n✓ Hypothesis Testing\n✓ Bayesian Inference\n✓ R Programming\n✓ Reproducible Workflow\n\nSpecific areas offered by the service:\n✓ Linear and Nonlinear Regression Models\n✓ Time Series Analysis\n✓ Causal Inference\n✓ Classification Methods\n✓ Machine Learning\n✓ Deep Learning\n✓ Scenario Prediction and Evaluation\n✓ Monte Carlo Simulation"
